        If maxlen is provided, any sequence longer than maxlen is truncated to
        maxlen. Truncation happens off either the beginning or the end
        (default) of the sequence. Supports post-padding (default) and

            sequences: list of lists where each element is a sequence
            maxlen: int, maximum length
            dtype: type to cast the resulting sequence.
            padding: 'pre' or 'post', pad either before or after each sequence.
            truncating: 'pre' or 'post', remove values from sequences larger
            than maxlen either in the beginning or in the end of the sequence
            value: float, value to pad the sequences to the desired value.
