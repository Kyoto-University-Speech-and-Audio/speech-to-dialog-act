      "well um i think the main problem is there's just not enough discipline and the classes are too big\n",
      "because um\n",
      "kids just get away with too much and there's not [noise]\n",
      "really that much that a teacher can do because\n",

      "yes\n",
      "[laughter]\n",
      "well this was in south carolina\n",

      "they basically\n",
      "didn't appreciate everything i was trying to do for them because i would have [noise]\n",
      "learning games all the time and i tried to do just fun things and make it interesting and do creative thinking\n",

      "you know ((that)) the students were already taking advantage of me\n",
      "um they just told me to just crack down and then they wouldn't support me in that\n",
      "and they just told that the only way that these students would respond would be if i had a completely structured environment and i was miserable\n",
      "doing that\n",
      "um-hum\n",
      "well yo- uh ((wonder)) ((what)) were the problems that you found in uh public school systems\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "we- we- i- i think the problem is that uh i- if you start concerning yourself more with discipline [noise] i think um\n",
      "i think teachers' main goal should be more instead of worrying about discipline is getting t- th- students or you know kids interested in learning because [noise] as i can recall where i went to go go- to school um \n",
      "most of the teachers were just basically bent on either trying to discipline you and then force you to go through this material and show no really interest i mean in to making it interesting or fun fun and and school were two oxymoron type of word \n",
      "[noise] and i think that was basically the problem because they were t- more interes- they built up this type of um\n",
      "[noise] i don't know uh this might not be in your case but at least where i went to school uh a superiority complex where [noise] they had to be always more intelligent than their students and it was impossible for students [noise] they felt more intimidated \n",
      "when uh people would ask you know questions that they didn't understand themselves so then rather than [noise]\n",
      "doing this they would either you know ridicule the student or tell them to shut up or you know this is not what we're doing this and so certain kids who would be interested in exploring different er avenues where just basically shunted because\n",
      "[noise] you know there- you know it- they were all more concerned that everybody follows along a certain path [noise] although i agree [noise] that disciplining is uh important um\n",
      "-[a]nd especially since [noise] there are in- uh in different areas where [noise] kids are already grown to\n",
      "uh a point of rebellion where guns as you mentioned [noise] but uh in general uh in certain areas i think if i- if they started earlier maybe not in just [noise]\n",
      "the high school level but i mean elementary school maybe you have to worry about [noise] switchblades instead of guns [noise] um\n",
      "[noise] that the students would you know if the teachers got kids interested more into learning rather than [noise] bickering [noise] you'd uh elimanate these\n",
      "[noise] pseudo-rebel roles that are created\n",
      "[noise] because you know if the teacher says they're different they prove themselves by [noise] you know uh um going against the establishment type of thing [noise] uh what do you think\n",
